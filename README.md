# Face-recognition
This project aims to detect and recognize my favorite two actors "Jacky chan " and "will smith" ,this idea came to my mind when i was watching a movie which is one of my favorits moments after a working day. 

## Dataset: 
I used the web scraping technique to collect the dataset from google image

## Steps To do :
- clone the project
- change the path of your dataset
- run train.py (to get features.npy and labels.npy files)
- run face_recognition.py
